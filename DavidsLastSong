\maketitle

\begin{center}
\noindent
David the son of Jesse declares,\\
The man who was raised on high,\\
The anointed of the God of Jacob\\
And the sweet psalmist of Israel, declares,\\[\baselineskip]

The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me,\\
And His word was on my tongue.\\
The God of Israel said it;\\
The Rock of Israel spoke to me:\\[\baselineskip]

He who rules over mankind righteously,\\
Who rules in the fear of God,\\
Is like the light of the morning when the sun rises,\\
A morning without clouds,\\
When the fresh grass springs out of the earth\\
From sunshine after rain.\\[\baselineskip]

Is my house not indeed so with God?\\
For He has made an everlasting covenant with me,\\
Properly ordered in all things, and secured;\\
For will He not indeed make\\
All my salvation and all my delight grow?\\[\baselineskip]

But the worthless, every one of them, are like scattered thorns,\\
Because they cannot be taken in hand;\\
Instead, the man who touches them\\
Must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear,\\
And they will be completely burned with fire in their place.\\
